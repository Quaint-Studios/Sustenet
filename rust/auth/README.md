# sustenet-auth

The auth portion for Sustenet is still in progress. It'll feature Supabase authentication for Steam / Epic Games OpenID and it'll link with Turso as a database solution both offline and online. There will be room for extending this functionality as well so you don't have to use those two technologies.
